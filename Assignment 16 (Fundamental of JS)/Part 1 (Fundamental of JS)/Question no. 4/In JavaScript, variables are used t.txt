In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data in your programs. Declaring a variable reserves a space in memory for that variable and associates a name (identifier) with it. Variables enable you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your scripts. The let keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript.

Here's how you declare a variable using the let keyword:

let variableName;
let is the keyword used for variable declaration.
variableName is the name of the variable. You can choose any valid identifier as the variable name (follows certain naming rules).
The statement ends with a semicolon (;), indicating the end of the variable declaration statement.

let age = 25;
n this case, the variable age is declared and assigned the initial value of 25. You can later change the value of the variable by assigning a new value to it:
age = 30;

Additionally, the let keyword has block scope, which means the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared.
