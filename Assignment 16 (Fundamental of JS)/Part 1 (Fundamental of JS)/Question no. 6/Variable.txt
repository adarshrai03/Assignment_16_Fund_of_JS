Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for several reasons, all of which contribute to better code quality, readability, and maintainability. Here are some key reasons why meaningful variable names are important:

Readability:
Meaningful variable names make your code more readable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, they can quickly understand the purpose and use of a variable just by looking at its name. This is especially important in collaborative projects where multiple developers may work on the same codebase.

Maintainability:
Code is read more often than it is written. When you or someone else needs to make modifications to the code, having descriptive variable names makes it easier to understand the existing logic. This reduces the chances of introducing bugs while making changes and streamlines the maintenance process.

Understanding the Code:
Clear variable names help in understanding the purpose of the variables and the overall logic of the code. It serves as documentation for the code itself. Well-named variables act as self-explanatory comments, reducing the need for additional comments to explain the purpose of each variable.

Debugging:
When debugging, having meaningful variable names can significantly simplify the process. Instead of trying to decipher cryptic or generic names, developers can quickly identify the relevant variables and understand their values, making it easier to trace and fix issues.

For Example :

// Unclear variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let result = x + y;

// Clear variable names
let numberOfApples = 10;
let numberOfOranges = 5;

let totalFruits = numberOfApples + numberOfOranges;
