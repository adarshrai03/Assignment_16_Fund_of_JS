Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are the main categories of operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators:

Perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
Examples:

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let addition = x + y;    // Addition
let subtraction = x - y; // Subtraction
let multiplication = x * y; // Multiplication
let division = x / y;    // Division
let modulus = x % y;      // Modulus (remainder)
let increment = x++;      // Increment
let decrement = y--;      // Decrement

2. Comparison Operators:

Compare values and return a Boolean result.
Examples:
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

let isEqual = a == b;    // Equal to
let isNotEqual = a != b;  // Not equal to
let isGreater = a > b;    // Greater than
let isLess = a < b;       // Less than
let isGreaterOrEqual = a >= b;  // Greater than or equal to
let isLessOrEqual = a <= b;     // Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators:

Combine or manipulate Boolean values.
Examples:
let p = true;
let q = false;

let andResult = p && q;  // Logical AND
let orResult = p || q;   // Logical OR
let notResult = !p;      // Logical NOT

4. Assignment Operators:

Assign values to variables.
Examples:
let x = 10;

x += 5;  // Equivalent to x = x + 5;
x -= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x - 3;
x *= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x * 2;
x /= 4;  // Equivalent to x = x / 4;

5. Unary Operators:

Operate on a single operand.
Examples:
let num = 5;

let negation = -num;  // Unary negation
let positive = +num;  // Unary plus (rarely used)
let increment = ++num; // Pre-increment
let decrement = --num; // Pre-decrement
